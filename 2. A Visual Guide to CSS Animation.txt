=======================================
2.1 A Quick Animation Demo and Overview
=======================================

Three thing we need when we create an animation: 
1º - Element in a default state
2º - Same element in a diferent state
3º - In a trigger iniciate a transition from the first state to the second state.

Always keep in mind: 
1º - Default state
2º - Modified state
3º - Transition

============================
2.2 2D Animation Essentials
============================

Every time an element is placed in a 2D space:
x coordinate - here is on horizontal space 
- left: decrease numbers 
- right: increase numbers
y coordinate - here is on vertical space
- top: decrease numbers 
- bottom: increase numbers

================
2.3 Transitions
================

We only can apply transitions on the non state.

=============================================
2.4 Transition Duration and Timing Functions
=============================================

Transition duration if we want an animation to goes fast or slower.
CSS property:

transition-duration: 
- the smaller is the number quicker is the animation.
- the heigher the number slower it will play out.

Transition Timing Functions control how quickly the animations is played in various points in the duration. 

transition-timing-function:
- linear - same speed from start to finish
- ease-in - slow in first and speed in the end
- ease-out - fast in the start and slow in the end

===============
2.5 Transforms
===============

Transform the shape of the element itself
- position
- scale 
- rotation
- skew

transform: scale(x,y)
Default scale is 1 in x-axis and y-axis.

To move something is called translate.
transform: translate(x,y)

When we skew an element we skew everything inside it.
If we don't want the content inside to move we have to aplly another transform property to the child skewing in the oposite direction.
transform: skew(x-deg,y-deg)

Rotation happens around the axis is specified. For a 2D rotation we rotate the z-axis.
transform: rotate(deg)

=================
2.6 3D Transforms
=================

For 3D it's important: 
- z-axis
- shape realistic - prespective 

We should create a parent div with:
width: 100%vw;
height: 100%vh;
so we can give prespective.
